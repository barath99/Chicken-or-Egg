Egg
The hen that was formed at the first place must be formed from an egg. Hence it is the egg that came first. Moreover that egg is the one from a protohen which cannot be considered as a hen but the hen from the egg laid by the protohen could be possibly considered as a primitive form of hen which on evolution resulted in the present day hen.

Despite of what type of hen it is, it should be from an egg which is an important requisites to be a hen but in the case of egg, it can be possibly from closely related species.
