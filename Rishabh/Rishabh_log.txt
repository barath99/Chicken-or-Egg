git clone:
git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.

git status:
This is a command that is very often used when working with Git. It shows us which
files have been changed, which files are tracked, etc.

git add:
From the project folder, we can use the git add command to add our files to the
staging area, which allows them to be tracked.

git commit -m "Commit Message":
A commit is a snapshot of our code at a particular time, which we are saving to the
commit history of our repository. After adding all the files that we want to track to
the staging area with the `git add` command, we are ready to make a commit.
Inside the quotes, we should write a commit message which is used to identify it in
the commit history.

git log:
The logs will show details for each commit, like the author name, the generated hash
for the commit, date and time of the commit, and the commit message that we
provided.

git branch <new-bramch-name>:
It is used to create new branch.The new branch that gets created will be the reference to the current state of your
repository.

git checkout <branch-name>:
To switch to a different branch, you use the git checkout command.

git checkout -b <branch-name>:
To create a new branch and change to it at the same time, you can use the -b flag

git merge <branch-name>:
To merge the changes from a different branch into your current branch, you can use
this command.

git remote add origin <url>:
The git remote add origin command will associate our local repository with the
remote GitHub repository that we just created. We're essentially telling your Git
repo that we have a URL we want it to know about, and we give it the name "origin".
You do not have to name the remote "origin" but it is standard if you only have a
single remote.

git push -u origin master:
The git push command will then push our local Git repository code to the remote
GitHub repository (if you chose a public repository, this will publish your code on
the internet - via GitHub).
