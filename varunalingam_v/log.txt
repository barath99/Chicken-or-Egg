Egg
In the ever trending tricky riddle : Which came first - Chicken or Egg?

If we see the evolutionary heirachy Animals which lay eggs existed long before the first instance of chicken, so by Archeological Proofs Eggs were already there when chicken was created!So, Technically Eggs were there way before Chickens!!
But if the question is not simply chicken or eggs, if it is chicken-eggs or chicken then the riddle becomes trickier!! Why??
Because the chicken-eggs contain a special calcium carbonate coating that came from protiens that was first found in chickens only!!Then Chickens only had came first(compared to Chicken Eggs)!!!
Thus I believe in this hierachy Eggs, Chicken, Chicken- Eggs.So I choose the Egg!!
